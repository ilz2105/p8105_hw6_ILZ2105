# Problem 1

I will load and tidy the dataset `birthweight` for regression analysis.
I converted `frace`, `mrace`, `babysex`, and `malform` to factors;
confirmed no missing variables; and standardized variables to the metric
system, so I converted `delwt`, `ppwt`, and `wtgain`, from pounds to
grams, and `mheight` from inches to cm.

``` r
# load data
bwt_data = read.csv("./birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
   frace = as.factor(frace),
   frace = recode(frace,
    "1" = "White", 
    "2" = "Black", 
    "3" = "Asian", 
    "4" = "Puerto Rican", 
    "8" = "Other", 
    "9" = "Unknown"),
   mrace = as.factor(mrace),
   mrace = recode(mrace, 
    "1" = "White", 
    "2" = "Black", 
    "3" = "Asian", 
    "4" = "Puerto Rican", 
    "8" = "Other"),
   babysex = as.factor(babysex),
   babysex = recode(babysex, 
     "1" = "male", 
    "2" = "female"),
   malform = as.factor(malform),
   malform = recode(malform,
    "0" = "absent", 
    "1" = "present"),
   delwt = 453.592*delwt, 
   ppwt = 453.592*ppwt, 
   wtgain = 453.592*wtgain, 
   mheight = 2.54*mheight)
  
anyNA(bwt_data)
```

    ## [1] FALSE

``` r
# no missing values
```

Proposing a model for birthweight. I hypothesize that `mrace`: mother’s
race, `gaweeks`: gestational age in weeks, `pnumlbw`: previous number of
low birth weight babies,`ppbmi`:mother’s pre-pregnancy BMI, `smoken`:
average number of cigarettessmoked per day during pregnancy, and `ppwt`:
mother’s pre-pregnancy weight are a few of the factors that influence
baby’s birthweight (outcome). I will test each of these variables
separately to see if they are significantly associated with `bwt` by
running a linear regression model and assessing the plots to see if they
appear to be significantly associated. If they are, I will include them
in my final model as a predictor of `bwt`.

Testing significance of each hypothesized variable separately, I can
look to see if the p-value \< 0.05, or if there appears to be a linear
association in the plots.

Testing `mrace`, the p-values are all \< 0.05 except for Asian,
indicating a significant relationship between mother’s race and
birthweight.

``` r
mrace_model = lm(bwt ~ mrace, data = bwt_model) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 4)

mrace_model

Testing `gaweeks`, it appears to be significantly associated with `bwt`
when looking at the p-value and the graph.

``` r

Testing `pnumlbw`, it does not appear to be significantly associated
with birthweight.

birthweight based on the p-values and plot.

Looking at `ppwt`, it does seem to be significantly associated with
birthweight.

My final model with the significant variables associated with `bwt`:

``` r
final_model = lm(bwt ~ mrace + gaweeks + ppwt + ppbmi, data = bwt_model) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

| ppbmi             |  \-26.266 |     4.146 |   \-6.336 |   0.000 |

Next, I will plot of model residuals against fitted values. There does
not appear to be a distinct trend in the plot, there is a large cluster
but no apparent positive or negative trend for my model.

``` r
bwt_resid = bwt_model %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(fit_model) %>% 
  modelr::add_predictions(fit_model)%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(title = "Plot of Model Residuals Against Fitted Values")

bwt_resid
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

Compare your model to two others:

One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
effects only) One using head circumference, length, sex, and all
interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these

The RMSEs for my final model are much larger than the main effects model
and the interactions model. The interaction model has the lowest RMSE
values indicating that the `interact` model had the best fit, and my
`final` model had the poorest fit because the residuals were further
away from the regression line data points.

I used 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each bootstrap sample, produced
estimates of r^2 and log(beta0\*beta1). Then I plotted the distribution
of my estimates. Then using the 5000 bootstrap estimates, I identified
the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles to provide a 95% confidence interval for
r^2 and log(β<sup>0∗β</sup>1).

``` r
weather_bs = weather_df %>% 
  modelr::bootstrap(n = 5000) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = .x)),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy),
    glanced = map(models, broom::glance)) %>% 
  unnest(glanced, results) %>% 
  select(.id, r.squared, estimate, term)

Both the plot showing the r^2 values and the `log(beta0*beta1)` both
have an apporximately normal distribution. The r^2 plot shows the
distribution of the total portion of variation in `tmax` due to `tmin`
for the 5000 bootstrap samples produced. The mean r^ value appears to be
around 0.91. The plot of the distribution of `log(b0*b1)` also follows
an approx. normal distribution, with the mean centering around 2.01. The
max density for the plot showing the distributon of `log(b1*b0)`
estimates is slightly lower than the plot showing the distribution of
r^2 estimates.

The 95% CI for r^2 is 0.89, 0.93. The 95% CI for log(b0\*b1) 1.96, 2.06.
