# Problem 1

I will load and tidy the dataset `birthweight` for regression analysis.
I converted `frace`, `mrace`, `babysex`, and `malform` to factors;
confirmed no missing variables; stnadardized variable to the metric
system so i converted `delwt`, `ppwt`, and `wtgain`, from pounds to
grams, and `mheight` from inches to cm.

``` r
# load data
bwt = read.csv("./birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
   frace = as.factor(frace),
   frace = recode(frace,
    "1" = "White", 
    "2" = "Black", 
    "3" = "Asian", 
    "4" = "Puerto Rican", 
    "8" = "Other", 
    "9" = "Unknown"),
   mrace = as.factor(mrace),
   mrace = recode(mrace, 
    "1" = "White", 
    "2" = "Black", 
    "3" = "Asian", 
    "4" = "Puerto Rican", 
    "8" = "Other"),
   babysex = as.factor(babysex),
   babysex = recode(babysex, 
     "1" = "male", 
    "2" = "female"),
   malform = as.factor(malform),
   malform = recode(malform,
    "0" = "absent", 
    "1" = "present"),
   delwt = 453.592*delwt, 
   ppwt = 453.592*ppwt, 
   wtgain = 453.592*wtgain, 
   mheight = 2.54*mheight)
  
anyNA(bwt)
```

    ## [1] FALSE

``` r
# no missing values
```

Proposing a model for birthweight. I hypothesize `gaweeks`: gestational
age in weeks, `pnumlbw`: previous number of low birth weight babies,
`pnumgsa`: number of prior small for gestational age babies,
`ppbmi`:mother’s pre-pregnancy BMI, `smoken`: average number of
cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy, and `ppwt`: mother’s
pre-pregnancy weight are a few of the factors that influence baby’s
birthweight (outcome).

Compare your model to two others:

One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
effects only) One using head circumference, length, sex, and all
interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these

``` r
# main effects model
fit_main = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = bwt)
fit_main %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  rename(
    "Term" = "term",
    "Estimate" = "estimate",
    "p-value" = "p.value") %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 4)
```

| Term        |    Estimate | p-value |
| :---------- | ----------: | ------: |
| (Intercept) | \-4347.6671 |       0 |
| blength     |    128.5557 |       0 |
| gaweeks     |     27.0467 |       0 |

``` r
# interactions model
fit_interact = lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead * blength + bhead * babysex + blength * babysex +  bhead * blength * babysex, data = bwt)
fit_interact %>%
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  rename(
    "Term" = "term",
    "Estimate" = "estimate",
    "p-value" = "p.value") %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 4)
```

| Term                        |    Estimate | p-value |
| :-------------------------- | ----------: | ------: |
| (Intercept)                 | \-7176.8170 |  0.0000 |
| bhead                       |    181.7956 |  0.0000 |
| blength                     |    102.1269 |  0.0001 |
| babysexfemale               |   6374.8684 |  0.0001 |
| bhead:blength               |    \-0.5536 |  0.4780 |
| bhead:babysexfemale         |  \-198.3932 |  0.0001 |
| blength:babysexfemale       |  \-123.7729 |  0.0004 |
